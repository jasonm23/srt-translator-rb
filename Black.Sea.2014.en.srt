1
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,051
And we want you to know
that this has nothing,

2
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:19,080
nothing at all,
to do with your performance,

3
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,348
which is exemplary, by the way.

4
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,755
Look, the business has changed.

5
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,731
Marine salvage has changed.

6
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,761
We don't need
a submarine pilot anymore.

7
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,403
We don't even need a sub.

8
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,767
Now, you've never been on contract,

9
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,409
so redundancy,

10
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,979
well, that's out of the question.

11
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,273
But I spoke to Bob Toris personally

12
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,442
and he has insisted
that Agora make sure

13
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,543
that there's something for you.

14
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,779
And I'm pleased to say

15
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,549
that we can offer you
a settlement of Â£8,640.

16
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,723
I mean, have you got a pension?

17
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,433
Like a private pension?

18
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,060
I've been with Agora for 11 years.

19
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,901
I've been working
on submarines for nearly 30.

20
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,031
I lost my family to this job.

21
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:25,245
They... They'd like you
to clear your desk.

22
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,916
Today.

23
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,681
And before your last job,

24
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:29,810
you were in the navy for 15 years?

25
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,421
Aye.

26
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,813
Why did you leave?

27
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,607
I disagreed with someone.

28
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,516
Fuck-shit.

29
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:13,228
Yeah. That's some kind
of fuck-shit, all right.

30
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,899
Kurston, you okay?

31
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,695
What?

32
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,864
You look rough.

33
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,866
Yeah, no, I'm...

34
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,412
They've put me on these tablets.

35
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,606
Antidepressants.

36
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,499
Said... they'll balance me out.

37
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,277
You all right drinking, then?

38
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,253
It helps.

39
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,548
I can't believe
those bastards fired you.

40
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,217
I can't believe it.

41
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,385
It's a joke.

42
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:49,832
I mean, when they fired Kurston, okay,

43
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,433
he fat useless fuck.

44
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,294
No offense, man. No offense.

45
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,963
Yeah, yeah, suck my arse.

46
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,065
But fire man like you, fuck-shit.

47
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,969
They want me to flip burgers.

48
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,235
Fuckers.

49
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:09,743
When I was young,
all I think about was sex.

50
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,747
Now I think only money.

51
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,584
You're dog shit in this wonderful world

52
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,295
without money, my friends.

53
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:26,093
I saw Martin yesterday. My boy.

54
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,805
He's 12 now.

55
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,432
Saw him across the road, like.

56
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:37,938
Posh school. Nice house.

57
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:44,903
My own son being brought up by some
rich fuck I've never even met.

58
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,615
How's Chrissy? How she look?

59
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,120
Good. She looks good.

60
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,581
We don't have to take this shit.

61
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,361
We don't have to take this shit.

62
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,295
What the fuck you talk about?

63
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:08,135
I think I know a way
to... not be like this.

64
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:13,306
I know a way to get money.
Their fucking money.

65
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:18,812
But I can't do it, see.
I've not got the skill.

66
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,649
It needs you, Robinson.

67
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,694
It needs a man like you.
You could do it.

68
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,559
Just before Agora fired me last year,

69
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,660
I went out with them to the Black Sea.

70
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,329
We found something.

71
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,685
You're late. And you look like shit.

72
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,522
Where the fuck is Kurston?

73
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,233
He called me this morning.
He's not coming.

74
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,261
What do you mean, he's not coming?

75
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,805
He's sick.

76
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,030
He's sick?

77
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,866
God damn it. Well,
he'd better have cancer.

78
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,539
All right, listen to me.
Do exactly as I say.

79
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,611
Nod, be nice, don't be a fucking idiot.

80
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,279
Don't elaborate unless he asks.

81
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,449
Don't say anything
that you don't have to, okay?

82
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,383
Don't ask him his name.

83
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,954
And please, please, whatever you do,

84
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:36,056
do not ask him how much
he's going to invest in this.

85
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,940
Sir, this is Robinson,
the man I told you about.

86
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,109
What's your name and how much
are you going to invest in this?

87
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,147
So, in 1941,

88
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,374
Nazi Germany came close
to total financial collapse.

89
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,653
At that time, the Soviets were neutral,

90
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:09,323
but Stalin was terrified
that Germany was going to invade,

91
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:13,426
so Hitler used this and demanded
a loan from Russia.

92
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,431
80 million reichsmark in gold.

93
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,835
Now, nobody knows what happens next

94
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,003
because weeks later,

95
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,480
Hitler broke the nonaggression
pact and invaded Russia.

96
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,608
Four years of war, 20 million dead.

97
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,945
But in the '50s there's rumors
that started to circulate

98
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,723
in the highest ranks of the Politburo

99
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,783
that Stalin had complied
with the request,

100
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,352
that Hitler had sent a U-boat,

101
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:42,523
Stalin had stuffed it with two tons
of gold and sent it on its way.

102
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,333
But the gold never arrived,
and Hitler invaded.

103
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,196
- So...
- So everybody forgets about it.

104
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,032
But in the '80s,
an oceanic research institute

105
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:54,134
found a series of shallow
ridges off the Georgian coast.

106
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,304
I worked for a company
called Agora Marine Management.

107
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,749
They search for and salvage wrecks.

108
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,877
They found a U-boat
on one of these ridges,

109
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,770
just 90 meters from the surface.

110
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,647
That's reachable.

111
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:11,151
Mr. Lewis, they think it's the one.

112
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,487
In 2008 they took this information
to the Georgian government

113
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,658
and they offered them a deal.
The Georgians agreed.

114
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:19,993
And?

115
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,730
And a month later, there was
the Russian-Georgian conflict.

116
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,274
Borders shifted, and the ownership
of those waters

117
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,334
has been in dispute ever since.

118
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,737
The Russians don't even
know the sub's there,

119
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,948
the Georgians know,
but not its exact location,

120
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,507
and Agora can't go in
till the dispute's settled.

121
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,744
I mean, they're tied up in paperwork
and fucking politics.

122
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:41,473
Meanwhile that submarine
is just sitting on the seabed,

123
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,476
full of gold.

124
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,022
What is it you want from me?

125
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,694
I need a submarine.

126
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:59,658
Blackie here has contacts
in Sevastopol, but it will cost.

127
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,035
180,000.

128
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,939
And men. I need men.

129
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,706
Half British, half Russian.

130
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,877
It's a Russian sub,
so they'll need Russians.

131
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:20,720
I'll take 40% of anything
up to $40 million,

132
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,889
20% of anything above that.

133
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,683
That's...

134
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,230
Okay.

135
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,309
Kurston, it went well.

136
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,534
Give me a call back.

137
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,287
So how many men do we need?

138
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,082
It's a Foxtrot-class sub.

139
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,752
You want boat move,
need 12 men minimum.

140
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:58,466
Okay, well, we've got
the two of us, Kurston.

141
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,593
Then Reynolds.

142
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,263
And Peters.
Served with them both in the navy.

143
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,472
And Russians?

144
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,600
What about Yerzov on electrics, then?
He's a good man.

145
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,671
Big drunk. No, no.

146
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,397
Take Levchenko instead.

147
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,216
Levchenko.

148
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,443
Zaytsev on engines

149
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,445
and Baba on sonar.

150
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,905
Best ears in Russian navy.

151
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,950
For charts, Morozov.

152
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,289
This is Daniels.

153
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,458
How do we get into U-boat?

154
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,627
Use remote-controlled submersible?

155
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,004
- No.
- No?

156
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,240
The Black Sea fleet's upstairs.

157
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,632
We do it with divers.

158
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:44,538
Convert the escape compartment
into a hyperbaric chamber.

159
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,682
Sneak in and out without anyone seeing.

160
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,977
You need good divers for this.

161
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,048
Do you know Fraser?

162
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,523
I know Fraser.

163
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:56,717
Is psychopath.

164
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,818
Psychopath, he is.

165
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,695
But he's an incredible diver.

166
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,265
Half man, half fucking fish.

167
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:06,034
And Gittens,
he's pretty good in the water.

168
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,786
Wee gambling problem.

169
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,621
God damn it!

170
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:19,714
What?

171
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,841
Well, that was Lewis.

172
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,177
I'm going with you.

173
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,347
I'm fucking going with you.

174
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,060
I'm claustrophobic.

175
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,230
I'll bet you are.

176
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,757
Hi. It's Mark Kurston.

177
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,759
Leave me a message.
I'll get back to you.

178
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,530
Kurston, where the hell are you?
Call me.

179
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,877
Hello. Are you Robinson?

180
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,548
I'm a friend of Mark Kurston.

181
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,216
Aye.

182
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,552
He's killed himself.

183
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,766
I used to go round there
when I was a kid.

184
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,393
You know, stay there.

185
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:18,690
Well, they were nice, like, kind,
you know, helped me out.

186
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,973
He was on these pills
for his nerves, like.

187
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,074
He took them all at once.

188
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,120
Do you know why?

189
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,249
Well, they reckon
he did it for the insurance.

190
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,795
Say his wife's all right, you know,
for the mortgage and stuff.

191
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,591
He asked me to come
and see you, though.

192
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,926
Said to say he was sorry.

193
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:54,267
We were on a job. Now I'm a man down.

194
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,111
Are you hungry?

195
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,952
Are you sleeping rough?

196
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,126
How old are you?

197
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,503
19, nearly.

198
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,631
Not yet. I'm 18.

199
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,857
You ever been to sea, son?

200
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:26,958
Boats are like whores, the old ones
know how to look after you best.

201
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,711
A drop of oil
and it will work like brand-new.

202
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,444
God.

203
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,817
You work on subs now, Reynolds?

204
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:50,985
No.

205
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,015
What do you do now?

206
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,741
Paper round.

207
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,410
Paper round.

208
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,498
Are you laughing at me, boy?

209
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:10,671
No, no. I'm sorry.
I thought you were joking.

210
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,868
Got fired from a shit job
in a steelyard.

211
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,177
Fault of people like you.

212
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,345
Bankers.

213
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,014
I'm not actually a banker.
I work for...

214
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,182
Gittens.

215
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,377
Gittens hasn't worked in years.

216
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,421
Fraser's in and out of prison.

217
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,355
And Peters.

218
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,482
Peters cleans offices
for shit dicks like you.

219
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,192
Look, I didn't mean to insult you.

220
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,112
Start loading.

221
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,560
Get Zaytsev to look at that engine,
and Gittens, too. He knows diesel.

222
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,035
Levchenko, get him to
check the electrics.

223
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:44,330
Peters, you sure you can get a door
on that escape chamber?

224
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,108
I'll give it a proper fucking go, boss.

225
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,402
Wait, Robinson, you can't be serious.

226
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,904
Look, this wreck?
This wreck's gonna sink.

227
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,464
Fucking useless sub if it don't.

228
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,697
All panels.

229
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,199
Off. On.

230
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:38,050
A gyro, B gyro coincide.

231
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,828
A group's charged.

232
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:40,996
300 bars.

233
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:44,432
300. Hydraulics operational.

234
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,726
120 bars.

235
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,269
120? It's a little low?

236
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,396
Yeah, Blackie says it's usual
for a boat of this age.

237
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,773
120 it is. Ballast, twin pump.

238
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,968
Wait. What are you looking for?

239
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,194
The windows.

240
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,305
The what?

241
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,975
Well, the lads said I should give
the windows a clean before we head out,

242
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,576
but I can't find any.

243
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,122
It's a submarine. There are no windows.

244
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,750
What's the broom for?

245
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,752
There's no chimney, is there?

246
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,923
No, son, no chimney. Come here.

247
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,593
It's a good sign. They like you.

248
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,303
Stow that.

249
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,810
What you got for me?

250
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,840
So the batteries ain't that great.

251
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,441
They're only gonna be
charging up to about 70%.

252
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,387
- Zinzane says that...
- Zaytsev.

253
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,655
Zaytsev says that
the diesel engine's good,

254
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,392
but there's a fuel leak he can't find.

255
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,827
- It's dripping on the main turbine housing.
- Tell him to find it. Tell him to fix it.

256
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:50,399
Robinson. There's no escape suits.

257
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:54,460
And the radio, you know,
there's only one circuit working.

258
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,462
If that goes down...

259
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,464
We won't be using the radio.

260
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,967
We'll have the Russian fleet above us.

261
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,098
Good to be going out again.

262
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,976
Thanks for bringing me, boss.

263
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:13,714
I was sorry to hear
that Chrissy left you.

264
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,315
Good girl, Chrissy.
Sorry it went that way.

265
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,818
Thank you. Blackie.

266
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,888
- Yes, boss.
- Here, Peters.

267
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,155
What is "no escape suits"?
What does that mean?

268
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,893
No escape suits means no escape.

269
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,604
If something happens, you've only got
that shitty old radio for help.

270
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,898
Don't worry, banker.
We'll get you back nice and safe.

271
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,065
Actually, I'm not a banker.

272
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,567
Are those not escape suits there?

273
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,735
Diving suits.

274
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:38,504
But, I mean, if we got into trouble,
you could use those as escape suits?

275
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,908
Oh, yeah, sure, you could...

276
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,910
go out for 80 meters and, come back

277
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,844
on a short hose.

278
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,622
What, we can't...

279
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,082
Yeah, you see,
that's the thing about being on a sub.

280
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:53,686
Outside it's just dark, cold, death.

281
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,023
Gets a man thinking.

282
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,468
Gets him thinking what?

283
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,360
Thinking he's gonna fucking die.

284
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,534
What are you laughing at?
You don't even speak English.

285
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,376
Yeah.

286
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,094
Russians not happy.

287
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,765
About Tobin. They call him virgin.

288
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,061
Unlucky to have virgin
on a boat, Robinson.

289
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,396
Jesus. He's 18.

290
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:41,677
What 18-year-old do you know
nowadays who's a virgin?

291
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,471
This not matter. They call him virgin.

292
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,530
Now he's virgin.

293
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,616
Unlucky.

294
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:52,411
Well, I'm not giving in
to superstition.

295
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:58,751
Call everyone together.
It's time for them to know what's at stake.

296
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,053
How much gold we talking?

297
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:12,765
At least $40 million, maybe a lot more.

298
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:19,397
Those bastards fired
the man who found it.

299
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:21,941
Kurston.

300
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,820
He was a good man.

301
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,014
Gave his life to his job,

302
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,349
just like the rest of us here.

303
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,685
They fired him.

304
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,353
He killed himself.

305
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,188
They fired me.

306
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:38,749
They fired men like flushing
shit down a toilet.

307
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:45,339
Well, this time
the shit is fighting back.

308
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,844
40% goes to the man who's funding us.

309
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,805
That's Daniels' boss.

310
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,641
The rest...

311
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,812
The rest is ours.

312
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,651
Equal share, every man.

313
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,993
Back to your posts.
We leave in an hour.

314
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,875
Equal share? Jesus Christ, why?

315
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,444
'Cause they're risking their lives.

316
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,905
Yeah, but they would risk
their lives for a flat fee.

317
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,407
Just toss them the scraps, is that it?

318
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,076
What are you talking about?

319
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,285
Look, that doesn't have to...

320
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,678
What does that have
to do with anything?

321
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,681
Listen, Robinson, we are gonna be
on this sub with these men

322
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,251
and it's going to be
full of gold, right?

323
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,920
What happens when one of them
starts to figure out

324
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,189
that their share gets bigger
when there is less people to...

325
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,651
less people to share it with?

326
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,518
Boss, we're ready.

327
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,925
Closing!

328
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,175
Open main vents.

329
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,342
Yes, boss.

330
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,443
Open main vents.

331
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,347
Midships to helm.

332
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:15,573
Midships to helm.

333
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,285
Ten down.

334
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,452
Ten down, boss.

335
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:26,959
30 meters, then bring it back
to periscope depth.

336
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,298
30 meters, then back up to PD, boss.

337
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,387
Diving now. Diving now.

338
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,680
Zaytsev.

339
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,753
Zaytsev. Robinson sent me to...

340
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,472
Boss.

341
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,368
Zaytsev needs someone to help
with pressure on second engine.

342
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,037
I gave him Tobin.

343
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:48,540
Won't work with Tobin. Bad luck.

344
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,319
Tell Zaytsev to work with Tobin

345
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,420
or get the fuck off my boat.

346
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,392
Tobin, come here.

347
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,395
It's fine, all fine, easy job.

348
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:13,399
Zaytsev find leak, he make wheel sign.

349
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,276
You go here.

350
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,864
For Russian less, men'she.

351
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,977
For Russian more, bol'she.

352
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:29,456
He say less, men'she, turn valve left.

353
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:33,585
He say more, bol'she, turn right.

354
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,697
- Don't fuck this.
- Which valve?

355
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:39,091
This one. One, two, three in.
One, two down.

356
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,802
Men'she left, bol'she right.

357
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,204
- Yeah.
- One, two down.

358
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:46,333
No, no, no. One, two, three in.

359
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,501
One, two, three in.

360
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:51,671
One, two down. One two, down.

361
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,647
- Don't fuck this.
- I won't.

362
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:55,983
Enjoy.

363
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,447
One. One, two, three.

364
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,614
Two in.

365
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:05,784
One, two, three...

366
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:02,341
It's so fucking unfair
that they get the same as us.

367
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,953
Well, everyone gets an even split.

368
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,012
Is two million not
enough for you, Fraser?

369
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,791
You're kidding me, right? Two million?

370
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,293
Where these guys come from,
Shitsvillistan,

371
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:14,587
it's like 20 million to us.

372
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,188
They're fucking laughing at us.

373
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,301
What did you do?

374
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:23,028
What, did you just have a shit
in the bowl, did you, Levchenko?

375
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,030
Is that what you did,
just shit in the bowl?

376
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,435
All you do is bleat like a goat!

377
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:32,371
I worked for about three months on one
of those American Seawolves in the '90s.

378
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,206
- Did I tell you?
- And the food, is the food like...

379
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,749
Fuck me, the food.

380
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,278
The food is unbelievable, mate.

381
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,280
I'm talking about beef fillets.

382
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,157
I'm talking about broiled hams.

383
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,451
I'm talking about chicken jambalaya

384
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,593
with andouille sausage, motherfucker.

385
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:50,264
Christ. Jesus Christ.

386
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,458
And what do we get?

387
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,226
Levchenko's toilet in a bowl?

388
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:55,795
Oh, don't get me wrong,

389
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:59,841
I'm sure this is Gordon Ramsay
over there in GdaÅsk,

390
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,275
but, you know...

391
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,571
Oh...

392
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,754
What's your problem?

393
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,246
Take it easy, Fraser.

394
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:20,294
Fuck. They're laughing
at us, I tell you.

395
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,650
Come on, then.

396
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:47,487
You've been staring
at that thing for days now.

397
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,491
What is it?

398
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,234
This from your girlfriend?

399
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,792
She's not my girlfriend.

400
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,921
Well, you must like the girl.
She's pregnant.

401
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,756
I don't really know her.

402
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,179
Terrifying, isn't it?

403
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,482
Don't you worry, son.

404
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,317
You'll be going home a rich man.

405
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,153
Your boy will want for nothing.

406
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,323
Boy?

407
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,372
I told 'em you weren't a virgin.

408
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,539
I'm not a fucking virgin.

409
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,942
Kill all engines.

410
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,376
Who said I was a...

411
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,517
Engine, 360 meters forward.

412
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:15,742
Russian destroyer,
bearing west-northwest, 20 knots.

413
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,879
208 meters.

414
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,100
200 meters.

415
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,531
It's passing, heading south.

416
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,081
It's gone.

417
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:12,090
Revolutions three knots for one hour.

418
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,884
Then proceed as normal.

419
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,433
Baba, you're my golden boy.

420
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,917
Hiding from our own people.

421
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:43,413
Jeez. That was tense.

422
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,292
Tense.

423
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,295
Tense.

424
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:59,805
Not even "I don't speak English"
in Russian?

425
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,816
How can you stand it in here?

426
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:11,983
Give it a couple of days

427
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,694
and you'll be wondering
how they stand it out there.

428
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,031
No, it's mad down here.

429
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,327
It is, but it makes sense.

430
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,206
See us, lad, we're all penguins.

431
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,666
Penguins?

432
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,459
Yeah, penguins.

433
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,113
Put it in water and what have you got?

434
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,282
Something that's graceful and sleek

435
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,675
and elegant and strong, yeah?

436
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,677
And knows exactly what it's doing.

437
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,471
Put it on dry land
and what have you got?

438
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,291
Just a wee prick.

439
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,350
Just a wee waddling prick.

440
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,726
Penguin.

441
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,356
What are you gonna do with your share?

442
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:54,025
Bad luck to spend money
you don't have, boy.

443
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,238
Probably pay off some debts.

444
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,407
Give some to the wife and kids.

445
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,076
- I'm having a kid.
- Oh, yeah?

446
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:06,773
A little boy.
I'm gonna fucking spoil him rotten.

447
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,748
No, two million's not much these days.

448
00:36:08,848 --> 00:36:10,109
Two million more than
you've fucking got.

449
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,833
What's going on?

450
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,198
Are you confused or something?

451
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,049
Hey, take it easy.

452
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,495
What the fuck was that for?

453
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,718
This is our side.

454
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,716
Hey, you, don't pee yourself.

455
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:46,119
You know what they're trying
to do, don't you?

456
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,955
They're trying to get
that boy to kill himself.

457
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:50,983
Increase their share.

458
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,027
Didn't I say? They're laughing at us.

459
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,349
Shut the fuck up.

460
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,879
Shut up.

461
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:30,288
We're right on top of the U-boat.

462
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,401
Blackie.

463
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,335
Zaytsev has found the leak.

464
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,421
Needs to drain fuel line
before he can repair.

465
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,411
Take four, five hours.

466
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,262
We're on top of the U-boat now.

467
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,748
We need to run diesel
to charge the batteries

468
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,516
before we go deep anyway.

469
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:53,478
Get the repairs done first,
though, okay?

470
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,882
Robinson, some of your boys,

471
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,525
they have funny idea about money.

472
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,527
They think Russians get too much.

473
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,154
Everyone gets an even split.

474
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,991
- Okay?
- Okay.

475
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,590
I bought this one fair and square.

476
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,030
- What's going on?
- It's mine.

477
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,600
It's my numbers.
My numbers have just come up.

478
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,409
I've won 30,000.

479
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,145
He's saying I bought it
with him, but I didn't.

480
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,412
I bought the other ones with him.

481
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,815
Yeah, and so we've gotta do something
about these fucking guys.

482
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:57,610
Please, skipper, 'cause they're
already fucking taking too much,

483
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,947
and now they're trying to muscle in
and fucking rip us off!

484
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:04,049
They're trying to find ways
to take more and more and more...

485
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,548
You filthy lying bastard,
you weren't even there!

486
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:10,055
- What about it don't you understand?
- How do you know your numbers came up?

487
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,222
What?

488
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,684
Have you been on that radio?

489
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,856
Have you been on that fucking radio?

490
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,864
We are under the Black Sea fleet.

491
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,910
We are under the fucking...

492
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,705
That's the radio.
You killed the fucking radio.

493
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,764
- Give me the ticket.
- How we gonna...

494
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,768
Give me that ticket.

495
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,733
You risk all our lives for 30,000.

496
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,610
30,000.

497
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,615
All you listen to me.

498
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:16,522
Every man gets an equal share.

499
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,248
Every man.

500
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:22,361
Anyone who doesn't like it
is endangering this vessel.

501
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:26,005
Any man endangering this vessel
goes out the fucking tubes.

502
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:38,044
I told you. I fucking told you.

503
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,145
You gotta tell them
the deal has changed, okay?

504
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,049
They're gonna tear us to shreds
for that money.

505
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,425
Robinson, listen, I...

506
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,276
Take your hand off me.

507
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,487
Look, just listen to me.

508
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,675
Careful with this.

509
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,233
I know, I know.

510
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,564
Hey.

511
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,232
Bol'she.

512
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:40,205
One, two, three. One down. Men'she.

513
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,041
Men'she left, bol'she right.

514
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,451
Zaytsev. Zaytsev, I'm sorry, mate.

515
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:53,676
I never meant to...

516
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,720
Tell him I'm sorry.

517
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:05,605
Tell him I'm sorry.

518
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,941
Bol'she right, men'she left. Stupid...

519
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,068
- You fucking leave him alone.
- Fuck off.

520
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,236
Fuck you.

521
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,514
You Russians, you're pretty
fucking tough with a kid, aren't you?

522
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,307
I expected better out of you, though.

523
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,810
- Don't be an idiot with that.
- What, with this?

524
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,813
Why? You fucking brave against him.

525
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,413
Not so fucking brave now.

526
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,249
- Give me the knife.
- No.

527
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,750
- Give me knife!
- No.

528
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,086
- Give me knife.
- Fucking have it.

529
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,201
Jesus. What did you do?

530
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,763
What have you done?

531
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,432
Zaytsev.

532
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,060
Zaytsev.

533
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:56,891
Hold on!

534
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,116
We're going down!

535
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,812
You're gonna be away
for three months again?

536
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,526
- Daddy lives on a boat.
- Daddy works on a boat.

537
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:36,154
- Daddy lives on a boat.
- Don't involve him like this.

538
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:47,040
I get to see Steve.
I get to spend time with him.

539
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,401
He's not just a fucking photo
and someone I see on holidays.

540
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:51,169
What, that's why you left me, is it?

541
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:54,005
Nothing to do with his mansion

542
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,882
or his posh fucking car.

543
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,844
Chrissy, wait.

544
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,513
Chrissy.

545
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:06,851
Chrissy.

546
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:57,462
How long was I out?

547
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:00,298
About 18 hours.

548
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,468
The Russians have gone berserk.

549
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,971
Had to threaten them with
a flare gun to hold them off.

550
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,601
Main drive shaft's fucked,
shattered in the explosion.

551
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,145
Ballast tanks are ruptured.

552
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:18,149
And I reckon we've got about 36 hours
left in the batteries before we go dark.

553
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,720
Looks like the Russians
have got almost all the water

554
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,654
up the other end of the boat.

555
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,990
We've got the food.
They're gonna want that.

556
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,826
- And they're gonna want us gone.
- Quiet, you.

557
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:30,729
Fucking animal.

558
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,330
You've killed us all, Fraser.

559
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:35,500
You've killed the fucking
lot of us. Fuck.

560
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,713
Are we gonna die down here?

561
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,721
No way.

562
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,722
Morozov.

563
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,939
I'm not armed.

564
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,413
What are you saying?

565
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,374
You speak English?

566
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,418
Why didn't you say anything before?

567
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:03,045
No one speak me, I don't speak them.

568
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,091
I'm saying...

569
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,761
I can make this boat work.

570
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:14,098
We anywhere from here to here.

571
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,502
Which means we are on
one of these two ridges

572
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:19,145
or we'd be crushed, right?

573
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:22,508
If we're on this ridge,
we must be right next to the U-boat.

574
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:27,721
Now, this submarine was based
on the U-boat design.

575
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:30,224
So we find the U-boat, we get in there

576
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:31,850
and we take the drive shaft.

577
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,686
Been in the water for
70 years. Useless now.

578
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:38,956
No. No, the Black Sea's
anoxic at depth.

579
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:42,627
No oxygen. No decay.

580
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:46,339
There's perfectly preserved
Roman galleons out there.

581
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:49,133
Look, when we get in there,
we'll get the drive shaft,

582
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,537
we'll machine it and then
we'll put it into the engine.

583
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:54,039
And we get this boat off the seabed.

584
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:58,142
This boat is dead.
We not sail it or get back.

585
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,477
We're not gonna sail it.

586
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,255
We're gonna take it to the surface

587
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,549
and then we're gonna
get into the life rafts.

588
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,650
What if we're on other ridge?

589
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,652
Then we're all fucking dead.

590
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:15,477
Even if the boat is fixed,
we don't have enough men.

591
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,062
We haven't enough men to move boat.

592
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:18,537
We have enough.

593
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,373
But right now we need Baba.

594
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,501
Sonar's broken. We don't even know
which way she's lying.

595
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,337
Baba and Zaytsev back there.

596
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:30,466
When he killed Blackie,
they wanna kill him.

597
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,177
They wanna kill everyone.
They go crazy now.

598
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:37,624
We have to have Baba and Zaytsev.

599
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:38,849
And Fraser.

600
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:41,852
What he did is not forgotten.

601
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:47,092
But we have to have everyone
to get this boat up.

602
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:50,987
We live together or die together.

603
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:54,198
Now, one of you has to go talk to them.

604
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,928
It's worse now,
knowing there's a chance.

605
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:20,891
I mean, if we found out now
that it didn't work, I mean...

606
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:24,963
Peters, we can't have
those bodies lying about.

607
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:27,674
Take Fraser.

608
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:28,941
Put them out the tubes.

609
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,570
- Yes, boss.
- Do it decent?

610
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:40,077
I've got him.

611
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,917
Sorry, mate.

612
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,972
I think they're all coming.

613
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,137
- Ready?
- Ready.

614
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,351
Ready.

615
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:48,380
Go.

616
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,605
Go.

617
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:16,674
Stop.

618
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,975
- Go.
- Go.

619
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:41,141
- Stop.
- Stop.

620
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:00,885
Hey.

621
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,149
When we get up on top...

622
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,195
...I'm going to eat your liver.

623
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,580
Yeah.

624
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,916
We'll do this.

625
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:42,760
You're coming out there with me, right?

626
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,597
Well, you've dived before.

627
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:47,999
Yeah, but, you know, years ago.

628
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:50,976
I mean, fucking hell, look at me.

629
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:53,312
Oh, Peters, I'll look after you.

630
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:57,107
I promise I'll look after you.

631
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,629
Hey, Morozov.

632
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,634
I've got some sense of the landscape,
but it's vague.

633
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,782
So, what's he saying?- -

634
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,284
Baba thinks there is something

635
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,328
rising up from the seabed

636
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:13,958
about 100 meters away,
maybe 40 meters wide.

637
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:18,796
The rise could be the U-boat,
putting us here.

638
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,007
100 meters from the U-boat.

639
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:24,927
That's close enough. We can reach that.

640
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:28,415
Or what he's seen is a small hill,

641
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:29,848
which means we are here,

642
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,352
on the other ridge.

643
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,482
Baba said can be more accurate,
but take time.

644
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:40,359
Maybe days.

645
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:41,527
Days.

646
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:44,655
Look, I don't wanna interfere,
but I need a hospital.

647
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:47,032
- I mean, my legs...
- Daniels, shut up.

648
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:51,495
We do it now.

649
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:54,206
If we're on the other ridge,
we're all dead anyway.

650
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:57,501
What about the other diver?
Can't do it with two.

651
00:54:58,169 --> 00:54:59,503
I need another diver.

652
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:01,714
Do any of yours dive?

653
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,238
Come on. I am ears.

654
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,016
I'll do it.

655
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,186
I did scuba with the youth club.

656
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:27,573
Do that up.

657
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,200
Stick with Fraser.

658
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:33,871
Out there, he knows what he's doing.

659
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,949
We've only got enough oxygen
to do this once.

660
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,215
Make it count.

661
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,667
God, it's dark out here.

662
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,476
Just relax.

663
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:39,395
You're gonna follow me.

664
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:43,607
Fuck.

665
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,293
Here I am, mate. Just jump.

666
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,839
Come down quite slowly. It's all right.

667
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:09,341
Oh, Jesus.

668
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:25,482
Just stay calm, okay? Take breaths.

669
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:29,054
Now, you're safe with me.
I've never lost a man out here.

670
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,822
All right? Good. Let's go.

671
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:12,362
Right, that's the light on.

672
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,531
Not that it'll make much difference.

673
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:21,606
Stop fucking wheezing
in my ears, Peters.

674
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:24,109
Fuck off, Skippy. It's me emphysema.

675
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:26,376
It's like a fucking death rattle.

676
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:35,594
All right, skip, we're all ready.
We're moving out.

677
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:38,555
Okay. Look after yourselves.

678
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:40,682
Good luck, lads.

679
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,917
What's the seabed like?

680
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:13,090
It's like butter made of dog shit.

681
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:39,825
Shit!

682
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:42,828
Fraser! Fraser!

683
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:47,791
Tobin. Are you okay? What happened?

684
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,002
Tobin.

685
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:51,628
Fraser!

686
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,507
Shit! Fraser, help me!

687
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:57,843
Please, I'm on the fucking edge!

688
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:01,930
Pull me up.

689
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:04,308
You're all right.
I've got you. I've got you.

690
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:08,312
That was Blackie.
Blackie just went past me.

691
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,318
What happened? Come in.

692
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:16,778
We found the edge.

693
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:22,492
Is anyone hurt? Can we carry on?

694
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:25,037
Well, yeah,

695
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:28,290
Tobin might have to wash
his underwear, but we're okay.

696
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:32,002
Let's keep going.

697
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:37,299
Peters, how are you doing?

698
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:39,635
Yeah, it's almost done.

699
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:01,990
Oh, no.

700
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:04,644
No, no, no, no.

701
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:06,370
What is it?

702
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:09,915
The ground.
The ground's rising. It's rising.

703
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:12,376
We're on the hill.

704
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:14,461
Are you sure?

705
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:17,365
Are you sure?

706
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:19,633
Yeah, yeah, it's rising straight up.

707
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:22,829
There's no mistake.

708
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:26,556
It's not here.
We're on the wrong ridge.

709
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:03,468
It's here.

710
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:06,471
- It's here.
- What?

711
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:07,806
Say again. What?

712
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:14,339
I've found it. It's here.

713
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:15,981
- What?
- It's fucking here!

714
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,315
I've found it, Robinson.

715
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:18,608
- It was under mud.
- It's here.

716
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:20,386
Under the mud.

717
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:23,447
Well done, lad.

718
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:25,657
In the fucking mud.

719
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:27,555
Ears!

720
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,481
Jesus Christ, there's air in here.

721
01:02:58,691 --> 01:02:59,884
Can we take our helmets off?

722
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:01,135
Don't do that.

723
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:03,096
The air's turned to chlorine gas.

724
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:05,322
It'll burn your lungs out in a second.

725
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:14,498
Okay, it's good. Come down.

726
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:49,032
Jesus Christ.

727
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:54,579
Well, we knew there'd be
bodies, didn't we?

728
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,207
Why are they chained?

729
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:01,128
Is this a prison?

730
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:05,324
No, not a prison, son. It's a pantry.

731
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:07,425
- What?
- Cannibalism.

732
01:04:08,302 --> 01:04:09,719
Oh, Jesus.

733
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:13,723
Hey, let's get what
we came here for. Come on.

734
01:04:38,082 --> 01:04:39,166
Is it gonna work?

735
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:45,630
Peters, you fuck. Will it work?

736
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:48,466
The bolt holes need drilling,

737
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:50,802
but basically it's the same.

738
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:54,639
Tobin, help him get it out, all right?

739
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:56,141
- Right.
- I'll be back in a minute.

740
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:21,458
Oh, my fucking fuck.

741
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:25,045
Oh, my fucking...

742
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:43,798
Are you there?

743
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:45,065
Fraser.

744
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:48,360
We got it. We got the drive shaft.

745
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:51,055
Tobin and Peters are loading it up now.

746
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:55,059
Now, listen to me.
You be very, very careful.

747
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:56,743
That's our way out of here?

748
01:05:56,869 --> 01:05:58,370
- Got you.
- They've got the drive shaft.

749
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:12,910
Okay, we're ready here, skip.

750
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:15,830
Bring her in slow and steady.

751
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,055
Will do.

752
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:31,278
It's not moving.

753
01:06:38,286 --> 01:06:39,577
Come on.

754
01:06:41,038 --> 01:06:42,372
It won't budge.

755
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:48,044
Levchenko say trolley
pulling at nearly four ton.

756
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:52,283
Fraser, what's going on?

757
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:55,760
It's fine. It's just the mud.
It needs a bit of help.

758
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:12,803
It's moving.

759
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:14,404
It's moving now.

760
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:22,746
What's going on? Why is it so heavy?

761
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:28,293
They've got the gold.

762
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:36,468
It's too heavy.

763
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:39,830
It's what we came here for.

764
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:41,014
I'm serious.

765
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:45,310
We have to at least try
and bring it in.

766
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:48,271
Robinson. Robinson.

767
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:50,940
We lose that drive shaft, we're fucked.

768
01:08:00,117 --> 01:08:02,118
Tell them to lose the gold.

769
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:05,622
Keep coming.

770
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:11,628
Nice and easy.

771
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:15,283
That's it. That's it.
It's going fine now.

772
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:18,635
Okay, all right.
Just keep it moving. Keep it moving.

773
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:28,311
That's it. There you go.

774
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:33,191
Fraser.

775
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:34,359
Keep pushing it.

776
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:36,387
Fraser, it's the ridge.

777
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:38,238
We're heading right for that drop.

778
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:40,323
- Fraser, we need to stop.
- No, no, no.

779
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:42,059
Robinson, get rid of the gold.

780
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:43,910
Can you keep it coming, Fraser?

781
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:45,313
Yes, we can.

782
01:08:45,413 --> 01:08:48,441
We need to keep moving
or we'll never get it started again.

783
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:50,609
We'd lose everything.

784
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:52,737
Pull it round to the left.

785
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:55,505
- Pull it. Come on, pull it.
- Fraser, can we keep coming?

786
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:57,674
Your call. Can we keep coming?

787
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:00,552
Robinson, this is our fucking lives.

788
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:02,554
We can do it. We can do it.

789
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,348
Look, it's getting around.
Stay with me.

790
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:14,524
Drag it this way.
Come on, harder, harder. Come on.

791
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:18,804
We're almost there.
Just get it over this bit, we'll be fine.

792
01:09:20,197 --> 01:09:21,599
We'll be fine.

793
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:24,701
- We're not gonna make it, Fraser.
- Just pull it, Peters.

794
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:27,245
Pull it.

795
01:09:28,038 --> 01:09:29,914
You lazy bastard.

796
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:34,878
It's going. It's going.
The gold. The gold, it's going.

797
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:38,423
It's all gonna go over. Hang on.

798
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:42,469
Right.

799
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:48,600
Lose the fucking gold.

800
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:49,809
Fuck.

801
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:53,438
Get this under here. Roll it on there.

802
01:09:55,483 --> 01:09:57,843
Keep it steady. Steady.

803
01:09:57,943 --> 01:09:59,569
Peters, be careful.

804
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:01,889
We just need to get
over this one last bit.

805
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:03,239
Go on. Go on.

806
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:05,617
That's it. We've done it.

807
01:10:06,827 --> 01:10:08,062
Grab this arm.

808
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:09,355
Fraser.

809
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:14,918
Shit. Peters! Peters!

810
01:10:15,252 --> 01:10:17,670
Peters! Peters!

811
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:26,763
Oh, shit.

812
01:10:27,348 --> 01:10:28,666
Fraser, what was that?

813
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:30,099
No. No, no, no.

814
01:10:30,434 --> 01:10:31,768
Peters.

815
01:10:43,113 --> 01:10:44,948
So it's just sitting out there.

816
01:10:47,284 --> 01:10:48,493
What does it look like?

817
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:50,161
Like a shitload of gold.

818
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:52,940
I thought he could handle it.

819
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,192
Peters, I thought he could
handle it. That's why...

820
01:10:55,292 --> 01:10:57,001
I wouldn't have asked him otherwise.

821
01:10:58,462 --> 01:11:00,964
- Shall we bring it in?
- What for?

822
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:04,634
It's millions of dollars in gold.

823
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:06,678
So what?

824
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:09,290
What are you gonna do, take it up
and explain it to the Russian navy?

825
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,125
You want to just leave it in the mud?

826
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:14,310
Yes, that's exactly what I want.
What else are we gonna do with it?

827
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:24,305
Can you ask them how many men
it'll take to sail this boat?

828
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:25,989
Sail this boat?

829
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:27,865
Hey, we're not sailing it.

830
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:30,368
What do you mean, sail it?
We're not fucking sailing this boat anywhere.

831
01:11:30,494 --> 01:11:31,604
- We're going up.
- Shut up.

832
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:34,205
Morozov. Hey, hey, don't translate that.

833
01:11:34,331 --> 01:11:36,833
No, no, we are not sailing this boat.
We are going up.

834
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:38,084
Nine.

835
01:11:39,503 --> 01:11:41,045
In its current condition.

836
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:43,423
We can do it with nine.

837
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:47,343
Okay, great, nine. So fucking what?
There's eight of you.

838
01:11:56,186 --> 01:11:57,588
No, no.

839
01:11:57,688 --> 01:11:59,522
Look, I am not...

840
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:03,427
I need to talk to you alone.

841
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:04,694
Now.

842
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:12,410
Right, okay.

843
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:16,148
I'm gonna tell you something.

844
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:20,043
Look, I'm just a guy
who works for someone, okay?

845
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:23,212
This wasn't my idea.

846
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:25,214
Say what you have to say.

847
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:29,286
You're not getting anything.

848
01:12:29,386 --> 01:12:31,679
You never were getting anything,
none of you.

849
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:34,208
What are you talking about?

850
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:35,683
Look, who do you think funded you?

851
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:38,546
Lewis, the man in
the big fucking house.

852
01:12:38,646 --> 01:12:41,064
Agora, your old company.

853
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:45,344
We met Lewis together.

854
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:46,720
There is no Lewis.

855
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:49,807
Lewis is just some actor who thought the
whole thing was a team-building exercise.

856
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:53,159
Look, there is no Lewis, okay?
Agora set you up.

857
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:56,188
Why do you think they fired you?

858
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:57,815
The moment you surface,

859
01:12:57,915 --> 01:13:00,291
they'll perform an arrest
under maritime law.

860
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:03,404
They've already done a deal
with the Georgians.

861
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:06,172
They just needed muscle.

862
01:13:06,674 --> 01:13:09,118
No, no, no, you bastard.

863
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:11,579
Kurston told me where it was.

864
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:14,331
How would they know
Kurston would tell me?

865
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:19,185
He told you in a pub called
the Lauriston on June 18th.

866
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:23,272
We paid him $30,000.

867
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:34,367
I'm sorry, Robinson.

868
01:13:38,997 --> 01:13:41,207
I brought Tobin down here.

869
01:13:45,295 --> 01:13:46,989
He's a boy.

870
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,464
Okay.

871
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,452
Men are dead.

872
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:53,621
Hey, listen, that was
never part of the plan.

873
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:55,179
Plan?

874
01:13:57,975 --> 01:14:00,017
Look, God damn it, I said I was sorry.

875
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:03,521
Take it. Tie the door off.

876
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,483
It might keep you alive
if they get past me.

877
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:48,191
I'm going to kill him!

878
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:49,817
Baba, calm him down.

879
01:14:51,111 --> 01:14:53,597
Get the fuck out of our way, Robinson.

880
01:14:53,697 --> 01:14:56,433
He needs to die and he needs
to fucking die now.

881
01:14:56,533 --> 01:14:58,075
And then what?

882
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:00,145
We go up?

883
01:15:00,245 --> 01:15:02,022
We hand the gold over?

884
01:15:02,122 --> 01:15:03,607
They're waiting for us.

885
01:15:03,707 --> 01:15:05,651
Yes, they are.

886
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:06,876
East.

887
01:15:07,711 --> 01:15:09,212
So we don't go east.

888
01:15:09,963 --> 01:15:11,949
- We go south.
- Come on.

889
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:13,367
Samsun,

890
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:16,412
it's in northern Turkey,
miles from anywhere.

891
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:17,621
It's 100 miles.

892
01:15:17,721 --> 01:15:18,789
There are deserted coves there.

893
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:20,124
- I know it.
- We should go up.

894
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:22,918
Morozov. Morozov.

895
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:24,393
Can you get us to Samsun?

896
01:15:24,645 --> 01:15:25,838
Have you got the charts?

897
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:27,131
Yes, I have charts.

898
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:29,133
But I know this place, Robinson.

899
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:31,301
It's bad waters, shallow.

900
01:15:31,401 --> 01:15:34,138
We go round the shallows.
We get Baba listening.

901
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:36,682
The batteries. We can't
recharge the batteries.

902
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:39,476
We can't surface 'cause the fucking
navy's probably up there.

903
01:15:39,576 --> 01:15:41,145
We won't make it.

904
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:43,522
- How long? How long to take us round?
- 12 or 14 hours.

905
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:45,607
- 12 or 14 hours. Tell them.
- They'll track us.

906
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:48,152
They're waiting.
They're not just gonna let us go.

907
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:53,615
The Turks have a naval base in Trabzon,
20 miles up the coast.

908
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:55,909
They're not gonna sail
into the Turkish navy, are they?

909
01:15:56,009 --> 01:15:57,385
Oh, fuck this.

910
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,762
Fuck this shit.

911
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:03,542
Now, I'm gonna fucking kill him
and I'm gonna do it now.

912
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:05,294
All right, you can do that.

913
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,588
You can kill him, you can do that.

914
01:16:07,688 --> 01:16:09,423
And we can go up.

915
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:11,842
We can live. We can breathe clean air.

916
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:15,637
But if we do, if we do,

917
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:17,347
you'll live the rest of your life

918
01:16:17,447 --> 01:16:18,974
just like you've lived it up till now,

919
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:22,910
crawling on your bellies
for fuckers like him.

920
01:16:24,454 --> 01:16:28,025
People who get filth
like us to do their work.

921
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:32,044
People who get us
to make them fucking rich.

922
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,301
I'm not going home poor.

923
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:42,805
Not after this.

924
01:16:47,644 --> 01:16:48,962
Well, she's in a terrible state.

925
01:16:49,062 --> 01:16:50,313
Half a day.

926
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:55,234
Half a day.

927
01:16:56,820 --> 01:17:01,324
And, lads, that gold,
all of it's ours now.

928
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:04,243
All of it's ours.

929
01:17:12,377 --> 01:17:13,961
Bring it in.

930
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,917
Will it work?

931
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:35,001
4.3 tons.

932
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:10,578
What does that say?

933
01:19:12,956 --> 01:19:15,291
182 million,

934
01:19:16,626 --> 01:19:20,822
448,000 dollars.

935
01:19:41,401 --> 01:19:43,194
Come on, open up.

936
01:19:53,997 --> 01:19:55,581
Time to go to work, banker.

937
01:20:05,008 --> 01:20:08,219
Fraser, here's your glamorous assistant.

938
01:20:14,601 --> 01:20:18,171
Now, when he tells you,
pour this into here.

939
01:20:18,271 --> 01:20:19,605
You understand?

940
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:23,093
Fraser, listen to me.
You got a family, right?

941
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:24,886
What am I, your fucking friend?

942
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:26,847
I asked you, do you understand?

943
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:29,240
I got two little girls, okay?

944
01:20:30,867 --> 01:20:32,159
We're nearly ready.

945
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:34,245
All right here?

946
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:36,831
- Yeah.
- Skip.

947
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:41,403
I keep hearing Peters'
wheezing in my ears.

948
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:42,628
Shut up about Peters.

949
01:20:43,713 --> 01:20:45,506
It wasn't your fault.

950
01:20:46,883 --> 01:20:49,286
We shouldn't have brought
that gold on board.

951
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:51,595
I think it's affecting
your judgment, skipper.

952
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:07,236
Stop looking at me.

953
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:09,613
Look, you know he's not right.

954
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:12,032
I said don't look at me.

955
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:16,480
Now, keep your eye on this bubble
and on this depth gauge.

956
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:17,939
It's right hand down to dive...

957
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:19,915
left hand down to raise, okay?

958
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:23,210
Keep your eye on me
and do exactly as I do.

959
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:31,010
Levchenko says engine ready.

960
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:37,808
It's either going to work or not.

961
01:21:41,605 --> 01:21:43,189
Electric engines on.

962
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:11,926
You're never gonna spend that gold.
You know that, right?

963
01:22:13,136 --> 01:22:15,137
That shaft's not gonna last.

964
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:19,543
Fraser, if we carry on,
we're all going to die.

965
01:22:19,643 --> 01:22:22,019
Oh, fucking shut up. Shut up.

966
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:38,410
Revs for five knots.

967
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:41,956
Midships to rudder.

968
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:43,832
Ten up.

969
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:51,590
Ten up.

970
01:23:06,273 --> 01:23:07,856
Come on.

971
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:25,874
Come on.

972
01:23:43,893 --> 01:23:45,102
Sweet Jesus, we're up.

973
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:47,146
90 meters.

974
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:50,774
85.

975
01:23:51,943 --> 01:23:53,845
- 80.
- Is the engine holding?

976
01:23:55,655 --> 01:23:57,474
- 75.
- Engine's holding.

977
01:23:57,574 --> 01:23:58,850
Batteries?

978
01:24:01,911 --> 01:24:03,188
Batteries good.

979
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:04,496
70.

980
01:24:05,915 --> 01:24:08,151
- 65.
- Check all vents and closures.

981
01:24:08,251 --> 01:24:09,460
I want to know if the rudder's holding.

982
01:24:11,171 --> 01:24:12,504
Rudder's holding, boss.

983
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:16,091
- 60.
- Hold her there.

984
01:24:17,844 --> 01:24:19,428
At 60 meters.

985
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:23,474
Holding.

986
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:36,445
We've got a long way to go.

987
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:39,990
Let's get moving.

988
01:25:48,351 --> 01:25:51,296
Rocks off starboard bow.
60 meters closing. Collision course.

989
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:54,466
All back. Emergency full. Full.

990
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:56,009
Full astern port, now!

991
01:25:56,109 --> 01:25:58,136
Where the fuck did
those rocks come from?

992
01:25:58,236 --> 01:26:00,404
Shit. Turn that valve off.

993
01:26:04,742 --> 01:26:06,785
- Forty meters.
- Are we stopping?

994
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:14,501
- Twenty meters.
- Reynolds, are we stopping?

995
01:26:16,921 --> 01:26:18,130
Ten meters.

996
01:26:19,757 --> 01:26:20,841
Eight.

997
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:26,430
Five meters.

998
01:26:29,476 --> 01:26:30,976
We've stopped.

999
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:49,312
Where the hell did that come from?

1000
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,956
Where the hell did that come from?

1001
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:54,651
I don't know. We drifted off course.

1002
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:56,111
This stupid chart!

1003
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:57,544
Where the fuck are we now?

1004
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:00,839
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Oh, shit.

1005
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:03,050
Are we in the shallows?

1006
01:27:04,802 --> 01:27:07,012
Shallows is bottomed out.

1007
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:13,711
We can go back and around.

1008
01:27:13,811 --> 01:27:15,797
- How long will that take?
- Eight hours.

1009
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:17,549
- Eight hours?
- No, we need to go up.

1010
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:19,008
We need to go up, skip.

1011
01:27:19,108 --> 01:27:20,234
What's that?

1012
01:27:20,985 --> 01:27:22,152
Canyon.

1013
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:25,890
Can Baba get us through that?

1014
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:28,393
Robinson, it's 100 meters wide,
maybe less.

1015
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:29,644
How long to go through it?

1016
01:27:29,744 --> 01:27:30,854
Forty minutes, one hour.

1017
01:27:30,954 --> 01:27:33,330
But we cannot go through that.

1018
01:27:39,546 --> 01:27:40,712
Yes, we can.

1019
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:45,160
We go through.

1020
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,411
No.

1021
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:48,303
What? What did you say?

1022
01:27:48,471 --> 01:27:50,331
- No.
- What did you fucking say?

1023
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:52,375
You're gonna kill us all.

1024
01:27:52,475 --> 01:27:54,935
This gold, it's fucking up your head.

1025
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:02,901
Are you disobeying my orders?

1026
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:09,283
Are you, Fraser?

1027
01:28:13,496 --> 01:28:15,998
That's your gold, that is.

1028
01:28:16,874 --> 01:28:18,735
Two hours away from being rich.

1029
01:28:18,835 --> 01:28:20,627
Isn't that worth the fucking risk?

1030
01:28:22,213 --> 01:28:23,714
Get back to your posts.

1031
01:28:32,807 --> 01:28:37,519
Go back to your fucking posts.

1032
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:51,074
What happened?

1033
01:28:54,037 --> 01:28:55,537
Are we going up?

1034
01:29:04,714 --> 01:29:07,466
Half ahead. Two knots.

1035
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:33,950
Mass 110 meters starboard.
Clear to port.

1036
01:29:35,286 --> 01:29:37,162
Come left two degrees.

1037
01:29:37,914 --> 01:29:39,831
Revs three knots.

1038
01:30:13,157 --> 01:30:14,241
We're in.

1039
01:30:21,457 --> 01:30:24,459
Steady. Just hold her steady.

1040
01:30:31,551 --> 01:30:33,301
Fraser, listen to me.

1041
01:30:33,928 --> 01:30:36,263
Look, this is gonna
kill us and you know it.

1042
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:40,752
Look, it takes nine people
to sail this thing, right?

1043
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:42,920
Nine.

1044
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:46,690
If we lost someone, we'd have to go up.

1045
01:30:50,361 --> 01:30:51,653
Kill Zaytsev.

1046
01:30:53,197 --> 01:30:54,891
We can't run the engines without him.

1047
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:57,951
You can save everyone else.

1048
01:31:07,879 --> 01:31:10,698
Reynolds, Fraser needs more oil.

1049
01:31:10,798 --> 01:31:12,883
Get that oil for Fraser,
quick as you can.

1050
01:31:31,611 --> 01:31:34,613
Mass 40 meters starboard,
60 meters port.

1051
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:36,698
Rising slightly below.

1052
01:31:37,992 --> 01:31:39,811
Trim 80 gallons

1053
01:31:39,911 --> 01:31:41,369
aft to forward.

1054
01:31:47,627 --> 01:31:48,752
80 gallons.

1055
01:31:49,796 --> 01:31:51,296
Come on.

1056
01:31:53,382 --> 01:31:54,841
Come on.

1057
01:31:57,678 --> 01:32:02,182
Fraser, he has lost his mind.
We need to go up.

1058
01:32:03,267 --> 01:32:05,253
Think about Peters.

1059
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:07,771
It doesn't need to
happen to anyone else.

1060
01:33:08,916 --> 01:33:10,500
Fuck that!

1061
01:33:11,377 --> 01:33:13,003
Fuck you, you fucker!

1062
01:33:15,131 --> 01:33:16,199
Reynolds.

1063
01:33:16,299 --> 01:33:18,910
We're okay. We're in one piece.
But, Jesus Christ, Robinson.

1064
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:21,621
- How long before we're through?
- We're not gonna fucking make this.

1065
01:33:21,721 --> 01:33:22,997
Not you.

1066
01:33:23,097 --> 01:33:24,582
Morozov, how long?

1067
01:33:24,682 --> 01:33:26,000
20, 30 minutes.

1068
01:33:28,853 --> 01:33:31,605
We need to come starboard two degrees.

1069
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:52,250
Christ. Jesus fucking Christ.

1070
01:34:17,693 --> 01:34:18,845
Zaytsev.

1071
01:34:20,112 --> 01:34:21,556
The pressure gauge.

1072
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:23,182
Pressure.

1073
01:34:23,282 --> 01:34:25,518
Here. It's started going up.

1074
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:31,247
See? See that?

1075
01:34:57,191 --> 01:34:58,400
Oh, shit.

1076
01:35:09,078 --> 01:35:11,788
Zaytsev. Zaytsev.

1077
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:13,316
What happened?

1078
01:35:13,416 --> 01:35:15,109
We lose propulsion.

1079
01:35:15,209 --> 01:35:16,319
What was that?

1080
01:35:16,419 --> 01:35:18,003
All systems...

1081
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:19,989
Zaytsev's dead.

1082
01:35:20,089 --> 01:35:23,367
He smashed his head on the engine
when we hit something and he went flying.

1083
01:35:23,467 --> 01:35:24,702
And his head, his...

1084
01:35:24,802 --> 01:35:25,828
What have you done?

1085
01:35:25,928 --> 01:35:27,496
What do you mean? We didn't do anything.

1086
01:35:27,596 --> 01:35:29,874
- What the fuck have you done?
- We didn't do anything.

1087
01:35:29,974 --> 01:35:31,125
It was an accident.

1088
01:35:31,225 --> 01:35:32,293
Fraser, you killed Zaytsev?

1089
01:35:32,393 --> 01:35:34,170
What are you talking about?
It was a fucking accident.

1090
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:36,881
Sweet Jesus, we're fucked.
You killed fucking Zaytsev?

1091
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:38,507
- What the fuck does it matter?
- What?

1092
01:35:38,607 --> 01:35:40,885
Robinson, we have to go up. Take us up.

1093
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:42,845
You did this. You killed him, Daniels.

1094
01:35:42,945 --> 01:35:45,572
You bastards always do this.

1095
01:35:47,241 --> 01:35:49,492
You think you can take
everything from us.

1096
01:35:52,663 --> 01:35:56,025
Robinson, you've lost your mind, okay?

1097
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:58,293
You've lost your fucking mind.

1098
01:35:58,794 --> 01:36:02,380
He wants that gold so bad, he'll kill every
single one of us on this boat to get it.

1099
01:36:05,342 --> 01:36:09,205
You gonna kill me?
You wanna kill me, go ahead.

1100
01:36:09,305 --> 01:36:11,973
If you kill me, you
kill everyone on this boat.

1101
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:16,356
What the hell is going on?

1102
01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:24,345
- Back to your posts, everyone.
- Robinson, it's over.

1103
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:26,988
I'll tell you when it's fucking over!

1104
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:28,865
Robinson, it's the truth.

1105
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:32,436
Five...

1106
01:36:32,536 --> 01:36:33,771
Take us up.

1107
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:35,872
- Four...
- Robinson, take us up.

1108
01:36:35,998 --> 01:36:37,733
- Three...
- We need him, Robinson.

1109
01:36:37,833 --> 01:36:39,402
We lose another man,
we can't even go up.

1110
01:36:39,502 --> 01:36:40,569
Two...

1111
01:36:40,669 --> 01:36:43,171
He's right. He's right, Robinson. Yeah.

1112
01:36:45,841 --> 01:36:47,509
We just wanna live now.

1113
01:36:48,511 --> 01:36:49,761
Can we just live?

1114
01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:04,093
- Robinson, what's happening?
- We're going down.

1115
01:37:04,193 --> 01:37:06,069
- Oh, you fuck.
- We're going down.

1116
01:37:06,195 --> 01:37:08,597
I told you we wouldn't make it.

1117
01:37:08,697 --> 01:37:10,281
- We're going.
- Robinson.

1118
01:37:12,368 --> 01:37:14,285
- Hold on, boy!
- Robinson.

1119
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:19,707
- Hold on, boy.
- I'm trying.

1120
01:37:25,214 --> 01:37:26,381
Oh, shit.

1121
01:37:26,549 --> 01:37:27,924
Stay still, boy.

1122
01:37:37,226 --> 01:37:38,601
Where's the bottom?

1123
01:37:40,312 --> 01:37:41,563
Jesus.

1124
01:37:43,315 --> 01:37:45,366
Where's the fucking bottom?

1125
01:37:46,068 --> 01:37:47,643
Oh, my God.

1126
01:37:49,613 --> 01:37:51,114
Where's the bottom?

1127
01:37:52,741 --> 01:37:54,242
That's hull crush depth.

1128
01:37:58,998 --> 01:38:00,248
God damn, my ears.

1129
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:32,223
We need a prop.

1130
01:38:32,323 --> 01:38:34,157
Robinson, how can I help?

1131
01:38:34,283 --> 01:38:35,700
Get the wedges.

1132
01:38:37,953 --> 01:38:39,438
Robinson.

1133
01:38:39,538 --> 01:38:40,872
Pass me the wedge.

1134
01:38:42,666 --> 01:38:45,293
Put your weight behind that.
Hold it tight.

1135
01:38:47,463 --> 01:38:50,506
- Close this off.
- Hurry up. Come on.

1136
01:38:55,179 --> 01:38:57,680
We don't have time for that.

1137
01:38:57,806 --> 01:38:58,973
Tobin.

1138
01:39:00,184 --> 01:39:01,252
Tobin!

1139
01:39:01,352 --> 01:39:02,419
Robinson!

1140
01:39:02,519 --> 01:39:03,686
Who's under?

1141
01:39:03,812 --> 01:39:04,979
It's Tobin.

1142
01:39:08,484 --> 01:39:09,901
Tobin.

1143
01:39:10,527 --> 01:39:12,320
Tobin!

1144
01:39:25,834 --> 01:39:28,503
Fraser! Hold it.

1145
01:39:38,013 --> 01:39:39,430
Grab his legs.

1146
01:39:47,189 --> 01:39:49,190
I've got him.

1147
01:39:53,445 --> 01:39:56,030
Oh, Jesus Christ, no. Come on.

1148
01:39:56,198 --> 01:39:58,434
One, two, three, four, five, six,

1149
01:39:58,534 --> 01:40:00,978
seven, eight, nine, ten. One, two...

1150
01:40:01,078 --> 01:40:05,540
Come on, let's go! We gotta go.
This isn't gonna work.

1151
01:40:12,298 --> 01:40:13,548
Holy shit.

1152
01:40:16,927 --> 01:40:18,052
Fraser.

1153
01:40:19,596 --> 01:40:21,139
Where's Fraser?

1154
01:40:23,726 --> 01:40:27,645
No, Daniels,
don't close that fucking door.

1155
01:40:36,655 --> 01:40:40,976
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1156
01:40:41,076 --> 01:40:43,395
One, two, three, four, five, six...

1157
01:40:43,495 --> 01:40:44,996
Come on!

1158
01:40:54,965 --> 01:40:58,843
I thought I'd lost you, boy.
I thought I'd lost you.

1159
01:41:14,777 --> 01:41:16,985
I can't get the fucker open.

1160
01:41:44,807 --> 01:41:47,850
No. No. No. No.

1161
01:41:48,435 --> 01:41:50,812
Oh, shit. No!

1162
01:41:52,981 --> 01:41:55,024
Morozov. Help me.

1163
01:41:55,150 --> 01:41:56,484
Give me a knife.

1164
01:42:00,155 --> 01:42:02,599
Morozov, I had to.

1165
01:42:02,699 --> 01:42:05,535
The water was coming.
They didn't have a chance.

1166
01:42:05,661 --> 01:42:06,953
Help me.

1167
01:42:07,496 --> 01:42:08,871
Morozov.

1168
01:42:09,456 --> 01:42:13,376
Holy shit. Morozov! Morozov!

1169
01:42:18,006 --> 01:42:19,006
Are we still down here?

1170
01:42:24,346 --> 01:42:25,471
Aye.

1171
01:42:34,356 --> 01:42:35,982
I'm sorry.

1172
01:42:40,904 --> 01:42:42,029
Fuck.

1173
01:42:43,699 --> 01:42:46,909
No. No. No. No.

1174
01:43:08,891 --> 01:43:10,516
The sub has gone.

1175
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:13,561
All men dead.

1176
01:43:15,856 --> 01:43:17,106
Are we finished?

1177
01:43:23,071 --> 01:43:24,363
Right.

1178
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:29,744
There's three of these.

1179
01:43:29,870 --> 01:43:31,287
Escape suits.

1180
01:43:34,374 --> 01:43:35,625
Put that on.

1181
01:43:35,751 --> 01:43:38,920
There are escape suits on this boat
and you don't say?

1182
01:43:40,422 --> 01:43:42,423
I didn't want us to give up.

1183
01:43:42,758 --> 01:43:44,967
Men dead. All dead.

1184
01:43:45,093 --> 01:43:47,887
I believed we could do it.

1185
01:43:50,432 --> 01:43:52,934
They think we're dirt. We are not dirt.

1186
01:43:53,769 --> 01:43:56,338
They think they can tell us. They...

1187
01:43:56,438 --> 01:43:58,439
They? Who is they?

1188
01:44:03,278 --> 01:44:05,222
Who is they?

1189
01:44:05,322 --> 01:44:07,615
You hid escape suits.

1190
01:44:07,741 --> 01:44:10,284
You lie us, all of us.

1191
01:44:11,245 --> 01:44:14,898
You they worse than they.
Worse than they.

1192
01:44:35,143 --> 01:44:36,686
Put it on.

1193
01:44:37,354 --> 01:44:38,813
Put it on.

1194
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:42,984
All right, son.

1195
01:44:45,445 --> 01:44:46,597
Come on!

1196
01:44:49,157 --> 01:44:53,035
When you come out the tube,
you pull this to inflate.

1197
01:44:53,161 --> 01:44:54,537
- Yeah.
- Okay?

1198
01:44:54,663 --> 01:44:57,331
Remember, as you go up, you breathe out

1199
01:44:57,666 --> 01:44:59,834
or your lungs will explode, okay?

1200
01:45:04,548 --> 01:45:06,215
How much does one of these weigh?

1201
01:45:06,341 --> 01:45:09,453
12 kilos. Half a million dollars.

1202
01:45:09,553 --> 01:45:10,845
Can we put one in our suits?

1203
01:45:12,681 --> 01:45:14,682
Not if you wanna get
off the bottom, no.

1204
01:45:15,684 --> 01:45:17,351
It's for me boy, you know.

1205
01:45:21,356 --> 01:45:24,317
You two go. Someone needs
to equalize the pressure.

1206
01:45:25,235 --> 01:45:26,819
How are you gonna get out?

1207
01:45:27,863 --> 01:45:30,906
Emergency lever, in the tube.

1208
01:45:34,036 --> 01:45:36,203
Tobin. Hey.

1209
01:45:37,164 --> 01:45:38,831
You be there for him.

1210
01:45:40,375 --> 01:45:41,709
Your boy.

1211
01:45:44,087 --> 01:45:46,005
It's all that matters.

1212
01:46:15,410 --> 01:46:18,079
Go. Go.

1213
01:46:39,267 --> 01:46:40,836
Water.

1214
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:46,902
Morozov.

1215
01:47:54,426 --> 01:47:55,593
Land.

1216
01:47:57,137 --> 01:47:58,846
We have to wait for Robinson.

1217
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:04,643
Tobin, there is no emergency
lever in the tube.

1218
01:48:06,188 --> 01:48:07,354
What?

1219
01:48:08,482 --> 01:48:10,483
There is no emergency lever.

1220
01:48:13,028 --> 01:48:14,111
No.

1221
01:48:15,113 --> 01:48:17,114
- No, no.
- Yes.

1222
01:49:47,122 --> 01:49:48,581
Robinson.

1223
01:49:49,541 --> 01:49:51,292
Robinson!
